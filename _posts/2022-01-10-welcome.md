Important notes for Week 1:

1. Set up a [Github account](https://education.github.com/pack) if you don't already have one.
    - Choose a username carefully. You'll want it to be somewhat professional.
    - Fill in your profile information (real name, upload a photo)
    - This is public. Anyone who searches for you can see it.
1. Accept my Slack invitation to the course and send me a message. It must say (at least) your Github username.
    + Again, choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information
    + This is not public. Only those in the class can see it.
    + I have to add you to our class before you can proceed. Keep this in mind, and don't leave this until the last minute.
